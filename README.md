# Dolphins-vs-Pirates-Prototype
Dolphin's vs Pirates is a 2D game built with Unity in which the player controls a dolphin to move around and shoot sonar beams at fish.

# Gameplay
The player can control the dolphin's movement using the arrow keys or AWSD. Pressing the spacebar will shoot a sonar beam from the dolphin's location. The sonar beam will disappear if it collides with anything. If it collides with a fish, both the fish and the sonar beam will disappear.
The focus of this protype is to allow the user to get familiar with the controls, get a glimpse into the underwater world, and practice hitting fish with sonar beams.
